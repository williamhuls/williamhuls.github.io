        <p>      
            Hello and welcome to my page.  My given name is William, but since I can remember I've been called BJ.  I was named after my grandfather, and he goes by Bill.  My middle name is Jack, and when you put them together you get Bill Jack - or B.J. for short.        </p>
        <p>      I am a senior at St. Thomas majoring in Data Analytics with a computer science minor.  My concentration for Data Analytics is Information Systems, which is a fast-track program for a Master's in Data Science. </p>
        <p>      After graduation this spring, I am hoping to find a job in the field.  Ideally, it would be with a socially and enviromentally concious company.  I'd love to be able to apply the skills I learned in college in a way that is beneficial to more than just me.</p>
