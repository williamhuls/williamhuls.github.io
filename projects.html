                    This summer, I had the opportunity to study the irrigation system at St. Thomas to look for potential water savings.  The idea for this project came throughout last summer.  I worked for Grounds on campus, and also had some experience installing and maintaining irrigation systems.  I gained a lot of information about the system here and came to find that we don't know how much water is used for irrigation.
                    
                    I submitted a research proposal through the <a href="https://www.stthomas.edu/urop/">Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program</a> at St. Thomas.  For the most part, I studied the grass on the baseball field and ran an experiment.  I varied the amount of water on different plots of grass to attempt to find the optimal amount of water to keep the grass healthy.  The results from the baseball field showed us that watering 25% less than the normal schedule showed a negligable difference.  While watering 50% and 75% less showed a visible difference.  

                    Under the assumption that the rest of campus is watered similarly to the baseball field, we extrapolated the data from the baseball field.  Watering all of campus' 1,250,000 sqaure feet of irrigated lawn 25% less leads to over <b>2 million gallons</b> in water savings.  Hopefully, these findings will be applied to the irrigation scheduling next summer.

            <h2>Theology</h2>

                Last year, I took a Theology class focusing on Christian worship.  The goal of the project was to identify objects in a place of worship.  As seen in the image, I used numbers to identify the different objects.  We wanted to compare and contrast the types of objects between denominations as well as between the same denomination through history.  
                
                I studied the Roman Catholic denomination and looked specifically at the Last Chance Mass offered in the Saint John Vianney College Seminary on the St. Thomas campus.  After attending a few masses, I got a feel for how handled their worship.
                
                To finish the project, the class discussed what they saw in the denominations that they studied.  Others studied Evangeical, Lutheran, and Episcopalian churches.  There were many differences seen, even though all of the religions called themselves Christians.

        In my foreign language class, Spanish, we were given a group assignment.  Each group got to pick a Spanish speaking country to study.  My group selected Colombia.</p>

        One large tourist attraction in Colombia is the 'Lago Guatavita.'  A crater shaped lake formed for erosion at the peak of a small mountain.</p>
